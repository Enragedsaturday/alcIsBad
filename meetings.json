If you ‘think’ you have a problem or just want to know what happens in an AA meeting this is the place for you. We love to share our experience, strength and hope. \nOk here’s the schedule:\n**Monday is a general open discussion meeting, bring a topic or concern you have  and we’ll talk about it, great way to start the work week.\n**Wednesday is our Big Book meeting. Currently we are reading the first 164 pages. We read about 15-20 minutes then do open discussion. \n**Saturday is our big meeting of the week, we have excellent speakers lined up each week, you don’t want to miss this one. It’s a speaker discussion, so the speaker shares his experience strength and hope for 20-25 minutes then we open it up for discussion. The meeting stays open for 30-45 minutes after so people can hang out for awhile.\n\n**if you need a password to get in, it is     192928","url":"https://us04web.zoom.us/j/5202330977","phone":"","access_code":"","email":"joustdaddy@yahoo.com","tags":["Video","Audio","English","Open"]},"e4eca9d4":{"notes":"Zoom meeting reading and discussing Big Book  first Tuesday of the month we go through Tradition Checklist  6:30pm GMT\n\nZoom Passcode, if any: 155696","url":"https://us05web.zoom.us/j/3703454166?pwd=YzI5eVNSZEExcHd3WlE5M0JPM0hpdz09","phone":"","access_code":"","email":"Chippenhamb2b@gmail.com","tags":["Video","English","Closed","Big Book","Discussion"]},"3a8a67b9":{"notes":"Mondays: 10th step meeting\nWednesday: 11th step meeting\nFridays: Meditation meeting (including 15 minutes silent meditation)\nZoom Passcode, if any: 12","url":"https://zoom.us/j/622319760","phone":"13126266799","access_code":"","email":"pastorvic@hotmail.com","tags":["Video","English","Closed"]},"a879333d":{"notes":"Chairperson will share for 10-15 minutes, pick a topic and call from the body to share on the topic.\n\nZoom Passcode, if any: sober","url":"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/3012613087?pwd=skVZOVRply9uVOdja2FBaGpjZGhOZz09","phone":"","access_code":"","email":"aadecompressionchamber@gmail.com","tags":["Video","English","Speaker","Discussion"]},"7a24f258":{"notes":"Sunday: Women's speaker meeting.

A Step / Tradition meeting which is focused on Bill Wilsons letter published in the AA Grapevine in January 1958 entitled \"The Next Frontier: Emotional Sobriety\" by Bill Wilson. Each week the speaker will focus a 15 or 20 minute share on a question as it relates to one of the Steps or Traditions. As an example here are two questions related to Step One: 1. How have I used alcohol to escape from my emotions? 2. Which feelings may keep me from facing my powerlessness?\n\nZoom Passcode, if any: 060621","url":"https://us06web.zoom.us/j/96067832512?pwd=MGdiNFB4dEkvY3ZMTFhLT3JMMUMrUT09","phone":"","access_code":"60621","email":"emotionalsobrietyinternational@gmail.com","tags":["Video","Chat","English","Open","Speaker","Discussion"]},"0b9829bc":{"notes":"Preamblers was founded about 30 years ago in Charlottesville, VA.
