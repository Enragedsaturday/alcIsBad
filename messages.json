    "message":{"messageId": 9,"title":"Notification","content":"All,\nSorry about the mismatched text in the daily reflection today. That is due to the parser I wrote misinterpreting where everything should go. It's all there, it just looks weird. I have to do all things while not violating AA's copyright which makes things more difficult than they could be. This week I've spent everyday going over the app. The next update should have some other fixes here and there, but I'm starting to work on features that people have been requesting. As well as putting in failsafes for things like the daily reflection and the meeting finder (both went down this week, and both reasons were due to outside things I don't control, talk about a stressful couple of days). As always I appreciate the supporters of the app, and I hope everyone has a great sober day. \n-Ben S","appleLink":"","androidLink":"", "dontDisplay": true}
