The meeting finder is run by the online intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous, and I have notified them. It is up to them to resolve the issue, and I expect that it is to be resolved soon. Please check to see if it is working as this message may still be up for a little bit when the meeting finder goes back online. I plan to move to my own implementation of the meeting finder in the future, as these outages happen every once in a while. \n-Ben S","appleLink":"","androidLink":"", "dontDisplay": true}
