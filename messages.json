This issue previously affected iPhone users, and now it looks like it’s Team Android’s turn. \n\nIn the meantime, there is a temporary workaround: open the Daily Reflection. The first attempt will show an error and try to load directly from AA.org, which will fail. If you try again, it should load successfully. This will also unlock access to all of your literature in PDF format.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience. A permanent fix will be released as soon as possible. Please do not send notifications through the contact page, as I am already aware of the issue.\n\n-Ben S","appleLink":"","androidLink":"", "dontDisplay": false}
