{"messageId": 0,"title":"A Message","content":"Friends,\nAs you may have been aware, some features of the app have not been working correctly over the past few days. AA changed the website, and this basically broke all of the features that rely on the website. If you are seeing this it means that your app is updated, and you should be good to go. If you find any more bugs or issues please email me, using the contact us page available at the bottom of the home screen and let me know.\n\nI built and maintain this app in my free time. I have done it as a twelfth step. There are no ads, payed options, and I don't accept donations. I am a member of AA just like you, and do my best to carry the message. During the past 3 days I have worked in excess of 40 hours to fix all of the issues. I have recieved and responded to hundreds of emails. Despite this fact, some people have left poor reviews because of the temporary inconvenience. If you have the oppurtunity I would ask that you go to the app store and leave a rating, or write a review. It means a lot to me.\n\nI hope you have a happy and SOBER Holiday Season,\nBen S - Everything AA Developer","appleLink":"","androidLink":""}
